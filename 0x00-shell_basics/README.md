# Requirements
## General
    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
    All your scripts should be exactly two lines long ($ wc -l file should print 2)
    All your files should end with a new line (why?)
    The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
    A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, describing what each script is doing
    You are not allowed to use backticks, &&, || or ;
    All your scripts must be executable. To make your file executable, use the chmod command: chmod u+x file. Later, we‚Äôll learn more about how to utilize this command.
## More Info
    In order to test your scripts, you will need to use this command: chmod u+x file.
    We will see later what does chmod mean and do, but you can have a look at man chmod if you are curious.
